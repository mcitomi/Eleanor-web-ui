# Eleanor WEB UI 
A lightweight web interface for the Eleanor chess engine, built with Bun, React, and TypeScript.
It manages multiple concurrent sessions by spawning isolated UCI engine child processes per user.
Each session tracks activity, handles custom FEN positions, and auto-terminates after inactivity, providing efficient and scalable real-time chess play via a simple REST API.
