# Eleanor WEB UI 
A lightweight web interface for the Eleanor chess engine, built with Bun, React, and TypeScript.

### ‚ôüÔ∏è Features
- It manages multiple concurrent sessions by spawning isolated UCI engine child processes per user.

- Each session tracks activity, handles custom FEN positions, and auto-terminates after inactivity, providing efficient and scalable real-time chess play via a simple REST API.
